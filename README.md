# intersection-observer-api and React Hooks

- Simple project to explore the features of the Javascript Intersection Observer API with ReactJS
- App pulls the top ten trending GIFs as mp4s from GIPHY
- Each video element has an observer attached to it which pauses or initiates playback depending on how much of the element is visible
- At the end of the list is an invisible element with an attached observer. When it intersects with the viewport more GIFs are fetched
- The React Context API and Hooks are used for state management
- Project published to github pages at https://brien-crean.github.io/intersection-observer-api/
